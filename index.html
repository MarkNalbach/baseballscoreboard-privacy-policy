    <h1>Privacy Policy for BaseballScoreboard App</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 5, 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>BaseballScoreboard App</strong>! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our app, especially regarding advertising via AdMob.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></p>
    <p>Currently, BaseballScoreboard does not directly collect, store, or process any personal information from users. However, our app uses **AdMob**, a third-party advertising service by Google, which may collect certain information for the purpose of serving personalized or non-personalized ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> This includes data such as IP address, device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers (e.g., Android ID, IDFA on iOS).</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Interaction Data:</strong> This includes data about how users interact with ads, such as clicks, impressions, and engagement metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location information, derived from IP address or GPS, may be collected for the purpose of serving location-based ads.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how AdMob collects and processes user data, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/ads/" target="_blank">Google Ads Policies</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Third-Party Services (AdMob)</strong></p>
    <p>Our app uses AdMob by Google to display advertisements. AdMob may collect the following data for the purpose of serving personalized or non-personalized ads:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong> This includes unique identifiers (e.g., device ID, advertising ID), device type, operating system, and app version.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Interaction Data:</strong> Data on user engagement with ads, including impressions, clicks, and how users interact with ads within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> Approximate geographic location derived from the IP address or GPS coordinates (if location services are enabled).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If personalized ads are enabled, Google may use this data for creating user profiles, targeting ads based on user interests, and improving the ad experience. For non-personalized ads, Google will use the collected data to serve generic ads based on the user's device and region.</p>

    <p><strong>3. How We Use Information</strong></p>
    <p>We do not collect or use any personal data directly. Data collected by AdMob is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Relevant Ads:</strong> AdMob uses the collected data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads based on user interests and location.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure Ad Performance:</strong> Data is used to measure the performance of ads, including impressions, clicks, and other engagement metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevent Fraud:</strong> AdMob may use data to detect and prevent fraud and abuse related to the advertisements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are in the EU or other regions with data privacy regulations, you may be required to provide consent for personalized ads before they are shown.</p>
